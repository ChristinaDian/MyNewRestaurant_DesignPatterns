# MyNewRestaurant_DesignPatterns
A young boy has successfully completed a course for chefs. Decided to open a small burger restaurant.
Since he did not have much capital, he hired only one employee - a cashier. There were only the two of them in the restaurant. 
The chef had access to a kitchen where he could prepare three types of burgers - king, classic and vegetarian. 
Various sauces could be added to the burgers. The workflow went like this: The cashier would take an order and tell the chef what burger to make. 
The chef was preparing the corresponding burger in the kitchen.Garlic sauce or ketchup could be added to the finished burger.

These design-patterns used:
Restaurant - Â Singleton 
Cashier and Chef - Command 
Kitchen and burgers - Factory
Adding sauces to a burger - Decorator
